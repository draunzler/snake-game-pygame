just download and run the code on any IDE.

MUST HAVE Python installed and `pygame` package

To install the `pygame` package:

- open Terminal in your IDE
- go to the directory where `python.exe` is installed
- install `pip` if not installed by using the command `python get-pip.py`
- it will install a folder named `scripts` inside the directory where `python.exe` is installed
- go to that further directory and use the command `pip install pygame`
